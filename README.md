# OPENMSX4ANDROID
An unofficial port for Android of almost perfect MSX emulator available.

# DISCLAIMER
I'm not owner of OpenMSX project (https://openmsx.org/), I'm just a MSX enthusiast that loves this almost perfect MSX emulator to emulate Brazilian machines (MSX Expert, Sharp HotBit). 

I just used the OpenMSX source files project as a giant library to enable it to run on most modern Android Platform, and made some patches that I'll give back to community to help creating an official Android version.

# ABOUT PROJECT

This port project was started after I created an OpenMSX 21 image with some addons for Raspberry PI platform (checkout my repo: https://github.com/CleversonSA/uosxpi).

OpenMSX has uppon a time an official Android port, but it's outdated and doesn't work for modern Android devices, and the 21 version had optimizations that the old port was not prepared.

Android devices are more widely available than Raspberry PI's, and at Facebook's Brazilian MSX community (https://www.facebook.com/groups/msxbrasiloficial/?locale=pt_BR) the idea of a OpenMSX port was very accepted!

I own real MSX hardware devices, but I keep in mind to give who doesn't want to spend a bunch of money for a real and rare old hardware, in order to bring nostaugia, and for who that never used the MSX platform. Carrying an "MSX" inside the pocket, available anytime you want, just for games or BASIC programming, for me it's amazing! 

I've spent about 2 months to the beta version, applying AI to helping me understanding the deep OpenMSX architeture (specially how to migrate OpenGL ES scripts to the version that Android understands), Android NDK compilation, Compiling extra needed libraries (tcl, SDL, ImGUI, etc) and so on.

This is not the final project, as I used the almost recent OpenMSX version from official repo (Version 21 from dec 2025). So I´ll keep updating it as possible as I can.

Enjoy "fudebas"! :)

# SUPPORTED ANDROID VERSIONS

ATTENTION: For the beta version (feb 2026), I had to use Android´s 14 NDK. So, older devices, older tablets, may not accept the APK FILE.

Check if your android device is Android 14 or newer. For development I used an cheap brand Android GO (14) tablet and a Redmi Note 14 device, both worked very well.

In future, as I got more experience in Android NDK development, I could try older NDK versions, to bring a new life for old tablet or smartphones.
